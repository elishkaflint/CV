**After 7 years working in technology finance and consulting (at O2 and BT), followed by a bit of time out to think about my next career move, I started learning to code in my spare time and haven't stopped since.**

**I’ve just learnt tons of great new skills on an intensive 16-week coding course with [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/curriculum/) and am itching to establish myself in a world that prizes creativity, problem-solving, structured thinking and teamwork as highly as I do.**

## Skills

#### Team Player

I am fascinated by team dynamics and love helping to cultivate an environment where people can do their best work. I give 100% to teams that I'm part of and care about both process and delivery. I'm a strong communicator and work openly - always keen to share feedback and improve things during a project.

* See some testimonials from previous team members [here](https://hackmd.io/z1KhNw8FRCSD4RdoQK8g2w?view)
* Take a look at a [blogpost](https://medium.com/@elishkaf/finding-your-flow-when-working-in-a-dev-team-cb09adbcbae5) I wrote about how to find your flow as a team during group work


#### Strong Independent Learner

I'm a self-starter, strongly motivated by learning new skills and technologies, and do not hesitate to take on new challenges for the learning opportunity they present.

* Visit a [Game of Life](https://game-of-life-elishka.herokuapp.com/) webpage which I built in 2 days in order to learn React
* Check out a [workshop](https://hackmd.io/qOg5TGiMROiOmUIXY7S0rQ) I delivered voluntarily to share my git learnings with my cohort at Makers

#### Clean Coder

I take pride in the quality of my code, striving to ensure that it is well-tested, flexible, readable, DRY and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

That said, I'm still learning, so I love getting feedback on my work and making it even better for the next time.


#### Analytical Problem-Solver

I've got a lot of experience working in high-pressure, dynamic environments to solve complex problems - such as helping BT's Board work out how to reduce cost on some of their biggest government contracts.

I understand how to break problems down into small chunks and take a structured approach to solving them. This skill has transferred nicely into programming, where I am able to find solutions and debug code quickly and efficiently.

## Interests

**Cycling** - I’m happiest when on my bicycle and in Autumn 2017 I set out on [a solo and self-supported cycling tour from Vancouver to Mexico](https://tinyletter.com/Elishka/archive), successfully navigating 2,347 miles along the Pacific Ocean
