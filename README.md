I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 2+ years experience working in agile teams on large-scale microservice-based architectures, primarily in the public sector.

To date, I've worked professionally with Java, Node, Spring, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Apache, Nginx, GraphQL, Puppeteer, Jest, JUnit etc.

I have strong engineering foundations that enable me to design clean, well-tested software and am able to get up to speed with new technologies and domains quickly.

As a Learning & Development Lead in the Engineering Guild at Deloitte Digital, I'm passionate about helping people grow as engineers and mentoring junior colleagues, with a particular focus on self-led learning for engineers.

Prior to becoming a software engineer, I worked in Finance and Strategy in the telecoms sector for 7 years, and bring real-world business and organisational understanding to my work.
